# Hop-by-hop SRTP

_Crypto · `srtp-hop-by-hop`_

_status: draft · audio, video, group_

Relay-facing SRTP layer protecting each client↔relay hop, independent of the end-to-end layer.

- Client↔relay media MUST use a hop-by-hop SRTP context independent of the end-to-end context.
- Suite: `AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80`.
- The relay supplies 30 bytes of `masterKey || masterSalt` directly. Hop-by-hop keying
  MUST skip the WAHKDF layer and apply only the RFC 3711 expansion (see
  [srtp-master-key](../crypto/srtp-master-key.md)).
